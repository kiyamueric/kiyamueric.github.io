## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

Lab 2
This lab was enjoyable for me as it was my first experience with coding. In this lab, I learned how to write simple lines of code. After completing this lab, I became more interested in the potential challenges and learning opportunities that other labs may have. 

Lab 4, part 2
During this lab I learned how to effectively use if statements. Learning if statements and seeing the results of this lab being correct made me feel accomplished since I struggled at the beginning with how if statements functioned. The logic behind if statements piqued my interest when coding this lab since it could be used to give other options. 

Lab 7
In this lab we had to code a function which determines whether parking was available or not. At the beginning of the lab it was difficult with different factors that contributed to the output, for example the time and street. This lab taught me how to organize the different aspects of the function. All parts of this lab was enjoyable and was by far my favorite.
